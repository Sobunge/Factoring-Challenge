# RSA Laboratories Challenge: Prime Factorization

## Problem Statement

RSA Laboratories presents a cryptographic challenge that revolves around the RSA algorithm. According to RSA principles, for each RSA number \( n \), there exist prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( n = p \times q \). The crux of this challenge lies in the endeavor to unveil these two prime numbers, armed with only the knowledge of \( n \).

## Task Variation

This challenge aligns closely with Task 0, a standard RSA problem; however, it introduces two distinctive modifications:

### Prime Nature of \( p \) and \( q \):

Unlike the general RSA problem, the prime factors \( p \) and \( q \) in this variation are explicitly stipulated to be prime numbers. This requirement adds an extra layer of complexity, demanding solutions that cater specifically to prime factorization.

### File Structure:

The input for this task is organized within files contained in this GitHub README. Each file encompasses a single number, representing the composite RSA number \( n \).

## Objective

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to develop innovative algorithms or methodologies to efficiently determine the prime factors \( p \) and \( q \) based on the given \( n \). The challenge encourages participants to adapt their approaches to accommodate the unique constraints introduced by the guaranteed primality of \( p \) and \( q \), while handling the single-number input structure inherent in the GitHub README files.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
